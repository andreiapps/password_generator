# Password Generator
Password Generator ia an app that can generate random passwords. To run the app from source code, download and run the main.py file. To build it from the source, download the main.py file and use a tool such as PyInstaller to generate an executable file. Please note that most tools like PyInstaller will generate executables only for the operating system on which you run it, so most likely you will not find a tool that can allow you to make a Windows EXE on MacOS, for example.
